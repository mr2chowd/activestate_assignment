<ul style="font-family:verdana;align=right">
    You have come to the right place, if you are looking for someone to talk about the phenomenal capabilities of Cloud engineering or if the volatility in the stock market gives you a good night sleep. With 6 years of experience playing with different technologies, finally I found passion in Cloud engineering and DevOps. As my hobby, I love to play and apply my theories to action on the financial market with focus on algorithmic trading. Very keen on learning how machine learning helps to fine tune my ideas.
    <br>
    <br>
    Looking to grow my career in the field of DevOps Engineer with years of hands-on experience in AWS. Provisioning and managing infrastructure or create lambda functions to make our everyday a little smoother or sit and watch the power of Cloud computing is a favorite work time feature.
